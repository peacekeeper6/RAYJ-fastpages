The ensemble song – by Carolina Gaitán, Mauro Castillo, Adassa, Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero, Stephanie Beatriz and the Encanto Cast – rises from the Hot 100’s runner-up spot and becomes just the second No. 1 ever from a Disney animated film. . “Bruno” also marks the first Hot 100 leader for the song’s sole writer, Lin-Manuel Miranda. He and Mike Elizondo co-produced it and earn their first and second trips to No. 1, respectively, in those roles.&quot; ~ BillBoard . . Lyrics . We don&#39;t talk about Bruno, no, no, no! We don&#39;t talk about Bruno... but It was my wedding day It was our wedding day We were getting ready, and there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky No clouds allowed in the sky Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin- Thunder! You telling this story, or am I? I&#39;m sorry, mi vida, go on Bruno says, &quot;It looks like rain&quot; Why did he tell us? In doing so, he floods my brain Abuela, get the umbrellas Married in a hurricane What a joyous day... but anyway We don&#39;t talk about Bruno, no, no, no! We don&#39;t talk about Bruno! Hey! Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling I could always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch It&#39;s a heavy lift, with a gift so humbling Always left Abuela and the family fumbling Grappling with prophecies they couldn&#39;t understand Do you understand? A seven-foot frame Rats along his back When he calls your name It all fades to black Yeah, he sees your dreams And feasts on your screams (hey!) We don&#39;t talk about Bruno, no, no, no! (We don&#39;t talk about Bruno, no, no, no!) We don&#39;t talk about Bruno (we don&#39;t talk about Bruno!) He told me my fish would die The next day: dead! (No, no!) He told me I&#39;d grow a gut! And just like he said... (no, no!) He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (no, no! Hey!) Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read! He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised, and someday be mine He told me that my power would grow, like the grapes that thrive on the vine Óye, Mariano&#39;s on his way He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach Betrothed to another It&#39;s like I hear him now Hey sis&#39;, I want not a sound out of you (it&#39;s like I can hear him now) I can hear him now Um, Bruno... Yeah, about that Bruno... I really need to know about Bruno... Gimmie the truth and the whole truth, Bruno (Isabella, your boyfriend&#39;s here) Time for dinner! A seven-foot frame (it was my wedding day, it was our wedding day) Rats along his back (we were getting ready) When he calls your name (and there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky) It all fades to black (no clouds allowed in the sky!) Yeah, he sees your dreams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-) And feasts on your screams (thunder!) You telling this story, or am I? I&#39;m sorry, mi vida, go on (óye, Mariano&#39;s on his way) Bruno says, &quot;It looks like rain&quot; (a seven-foot frame, rats along his back) In doing so, he floods my brain Married in a hurricane He&#39;s here! Don&#39;t talk about Bruno, no! (Why did I talk about Bruno?) Not a word about Bruno! I never should&#39;ve brought up Bruno! .",

Swift surpasses Drake, who logged nine of the Hot 100’s top 10 for a week in September 2021. . Leading the way for Swift on the Hot 100, “Anti-Hero” launches at No. 1, marking her ninth career leader.&quot; ~ BillBoard . . Lyrics . I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser . Midnights become my afternoons . When my depression works the graveyard shift . All of the people I&#39;ve ghosted stand there in the room . I should not be left to my own devices . They come with prices and vices . I end up in crises . Tale as old as time . I wake up screaming from dreaming . One day I&#39;ll watch as you&#39;re leaving . &#39;Cause you got tired of my scheming . For the last time . It&#39;s me . Hi! . I&#39;m the problem, it&#39;s me . At teatime . Everybody agrees . I&#39;ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror . It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero . Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby . And I&#39;m a monster on the hill . Too big to hang out . Slowly lurching toward your favorite city . Pierced through the heart but never killed . Did you hear my covert narcissism . I might disguise as altruism . Like some kind of congressman . Tale as old as time . I wake up screaming from dreaming . One day I&#39;ll watch as you&#39;re leaving . And life will lose all its meaning . For the last time . It&#39;s me . Hi! . I&#39;m the problem, it&#39;s me (I&#39;m the problem, it&#39;s me) . At teatime . Everybody agrees . I&#39;ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror . It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero . I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money . She thinks I left them in the will . The family gathers &#39;round and reads it . And then someone screams out . &quot;She&#39;s laughing up at us from hell!&quot; . It&#39;s me . Hi! . I&#39;m the problem, it&#39;s me . It&#39;s me . Hi! . I&#39;m the problem, it&#39;s me . It&#39;s me . Hi! . Everybody agrees . Everybody agrees . It&#39;s me . Hi! (Hi!) .

The funky, uptempo track the singer has been teasing for months dropped on Thursday morning as the first taste of Charlie, his upcoming follow-up to 2018’s Grammy-nominated Voicenotes. Puth, 30, breaks down the frustration of trying to walk away and getting pulled right back every time on the bouncy track that features the familiar click of a light switch on the chorus. The singer also dropped the official video for the song, in which a paunchy, crying-in-his-bag-of-chips bearded Charlie drowns his sorrows in junk food and basic cable workout shows after a bad break-up. But then the instructor jumps off the screen and puts Charlie through a Rocky-like body transformation that includes jogging, Jazzercise and a wardrobe upgrade. ~ BillBoard . . Lyrics . Yeah .
