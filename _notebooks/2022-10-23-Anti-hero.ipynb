    ">  As the lead single to Midnights, \"Anti-Hero\" is about Swift's insecurities and anxieties in life both publicly and privately. The song itself has been described as a collision of synthpop, neurotic image analysis, and dense lyricism brought together by \"a methodical drum loop\" and \"simmering synths.\" The track is a depressingly relatable one, as Swift deals with the fear of nothing, anxiety from everything, and doubting the ones she trusts the most. <a href \"\"></a>\n",
