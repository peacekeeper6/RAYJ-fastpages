    "# Bad Habits by Steve Lacy\n",
    ">  “Bad Habit,” with its mix of R&B and indie pop sensibilities, feels like it could have been released in any era of music, and few songs currently on the charts sound like it. It’s groovy and melancholy, the lyrics are filled with yearning and regret, and Lacy’s guitar strings whirl and wane. It’s a despondent anthem that remarkably manages to fit into everyone’s Instagram story montage. \n",

    "\"Steve Lacy, the breakout solo star who originally gained fame as a member of alt-soul band The Internet, has been a favorite of critics and streaming audiences for some time now. Now, he officially has his first crossover hit.\n",

    "“Bad Habit,” lead single from his July-released sophomore solo set Gemini Rights, advances three spots to No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 this week, in just its fourth frame on the chart. It’s his first hit of any size on the Hot 100, and already one of the biggest streaming breakout stories of 2022 — a year that hasn’t seen a tremendous number of newer artists scoring major hits.\" ~ BillBoard\n",
