    "Harry Styles‘ “As It Was” logs a 15th week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. Only three songs have led longer over the survey’s 64-year history, while “As It Was” claims outright the longest reign for a song by a British artist, as well as by an act with no accompanying artists. Harry Styles' 'As It Was' finds him facing down gravity and impermanence and arriving at what comes next.\n",
