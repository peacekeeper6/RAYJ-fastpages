## "We don't talk about Bruno"

"Maybe we’re not allowed to talk about him, but people were definitely listening to “Bruno,” with the secretive, salsa-tinged showstopper becoming only the second Hot 100 No. 1 from a Disney animated film, and the longest-running chart-topper (five weeks) for any song from a Disney movie. The song was built for repeat listening, with mile-a-minute lyrics and its finale of Les Miz-level vocal stacking. It even had its own TikTok trend, thanks to the meme-able way Camilo (Rhenzy Feliz) drawls those spooky “7-foot frame, rats along his back” lines. Basically, Lin-Manuel Miranda figured out how to make a song that perfectly advanced the Family Madrigal’s narrative, while also soundtracking countless school drop-offs and dramatic road-trip sing-alongs." ~BillBoard
