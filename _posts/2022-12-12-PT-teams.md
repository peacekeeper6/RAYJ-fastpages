## "Anti-hero"
"Taylor Swift scores one of the most historic weeks in the 64-year history of the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, as she becomes the first artist to claim the survey’s entire top 10 in a single frame.

Swift surpasses Drake, who logged nine of the Hot 100’s top 10 for a week in September 2021.

Leading the way for Swift on the Hot 100, “Anti-Hero” launches at No. 1, marking her ninth career leader." -Billboard
